Taigi Telex keyboard is a keyboard for typing Taiwanese be̍h-ōe-jī fast and conveniently.

The principle of fast typing of this Taiwanese keyboard is using combination of letters to replace numbers for input the tones of Taiwanese.

Using letter a as a example, the rule is 'd' represents 'á', 'q' represents 'à', 'w' represents 'â', 'v' represents 'ă','x' represents 'ā', 'x' also represent 'a̍' if there is a final consonant such as p/t/k/h, after the vowel.

The keyboard also set many doubletap rules, for example, doubletaping 'n' leads to 'ⁿ', double taping 'o' leads to 'o͘', doubletap 'a', 'u', 'i', 'e' also leads to 'â', 'û', 'î', 'ê' as same as press 'w' after vowels.

This Taiwanese phone keyboard set the tone marks within the range of users' left thumb. Users don't need to move their fingers far to reach every letters. 

In the default page of the phone keyboard, the numbers are moved from 'default' to the 'numeric'. This feature will lead the typing more simple, and this feature will suit the IOS keyboard of iphone for the future application in Iphone keyboard.

Only the hyphen above all numeric and symbols was remained on the right side of phone default keyboard because hyphen is the most frequent symbols in Taiwanese be̍h-ōe-jī.

This keyboard support users to type English. Once the user double tap the letters which represent the tones, those tone marks will disappear and the original letter will be generated after the vowel. This rule also works on each doubletap shortcut.

In this keyboard, the words and tone marks just generate automatically after you type each keys, you don't need to select the words above the keyboard like Chinese input method, such as the phahtaigi IME anymore.This typing way changed the way of thinking when users are typing Taiwanese pe̍h-ōe-jī.
This keyboard encourages users to think in phonogram way instead of logogram way.

This inspiration of this taigi telex keyboard came from the taigi poj keyboard and the vietnamese telex keyboard. The vietnamese telex keyboard is the most successful romanization keyboard for Asian languages. 
The feature of vietnamese telex keyboard allow users to type fast and type English. Those feature is inclusive for boarding language and creating new words, as the benefit of romanization writing system is creativity and inclusive.
Thanks for Ngô͘ Ka-bêng and Mike Vo to provide their source on github for me to reference.

I expect I can collaborate with Ngô͘ Ka-bêng and combine this keyboard with the Taiwanese character typing. I am planning to make a keyboard combining the Taiwanese pe̍h-ōe-jī, the English, the the Taiwanese characters, then contribute this keyboard to Apple, microsoft, and google.
I expect people will get this combined Taiwanese keyboard from the system setting of their computers and phone.
